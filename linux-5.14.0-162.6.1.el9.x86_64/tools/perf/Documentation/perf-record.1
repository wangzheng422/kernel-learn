There are also some parameters which are not defined in \&.\&.\&./<pmu>/format/*\&.

In some systems, where binaries are build with gcc

Using the "lbr" method doesn\*(Aqt require any compiler options\&. It
will produce call graphs from the hardware LBR registers\&. The
main limitation is that it is only available on new Intel

Do not save the build ids of binaries in the perf\&.data files\&.

save_type: save branch type during sampling in case binary is not available later
.RE

The option requires at least one branch type among any, any_call, any_ret, ind_call, cond\&. The privilege levels may be omitted, in which case, the privilege levels of the associated event are applied to the branch filter\&. Both kernel (k) and hypervisor (hv) privilege levels are subject to permissions\&. When sampling on multiple events, branch stack sampling is enabled for all the sampling events\&. The sampled branch type is the same for all events\&. The various filters must be specified as a comma separated list: \-\-branch\-filter any_ret,u,k Note that this feature may not be available on all processors\&.

The maximal allowed value is a quarter of the size of mmaped data pages\&.
.sp
The default option value is 1 byte which means that every time that the output writing thread finds some new data in the mmaped buffer the data is extracted, possibly compressed (\-z) and written to the output, perf\&.data or pipe\&.
.sp
Larger data chunks are compressed more effectively in comparison to smaller chunks so extraction of larger chunks from the mmap data pages is preferable from the perspective of output size reduction\&.

.SH "PERF\-RECORD:"
.sp
If there is no \fI\-e\fR specified in perf record, on hybrid platform, it creates two default \fIcycles\fR and adds them to event list\&. One is for core, the other is for atom\&.
.SH "PERF\-STAT:"
.sp
If there is no \fI\-e\fR specified in perf stat, on hybrid platform, besides of software events, following events are created and added to event list in order\&.
.sp
cpu_core/cycles/, cpu_atom/cycles/, cpu_core/instructions/, cpu_atom/instructions/, cpu_core/branches/, cpu_atom/branches/, cpu_core/branch\-misses/, cpu_atom/branch\-misses/
.sp
Of course, both perf\-stat and perf\-record support to enable hybrid event with a specific pmu\&.
.sp
e\&.g\&. perf stat \-e cpu_core/cycles/ perf stat \-e cpu_atom/cycles/ perf stat \-e cpu_core/r1a/ perf stat \-e cpu_atom/L1\-icache\-loads/ perf stat \-e cpu_core/cycles/,cpu_atom/instructions/ perf stat \-e \fI{cpu_core/cycles/,cpu_core/instructions/}\fR
.sp
But \fI{cpu_core/cycles/,cpu_atom/instructions/}\fR will return warning and disable grouping, because the pmus in group are not matched (cpu_core vs\&. cpu_atom)\&.
.PP
\-\-debuginfod[=URLs]
.RS 4
Specify debuginfod URL to be used when cacheing perf\&.data binaries, it follows the same syntax as the DEBUGINFOD_URLS variable, like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
http://192\&.168\&.122\&.174:8002
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
If the URLs is not specified, the value of DEBUGINFOD_URLS
system environment variable is used\&.
