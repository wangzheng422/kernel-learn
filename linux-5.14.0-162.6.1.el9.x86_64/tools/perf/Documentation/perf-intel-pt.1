.SH "NAME"
perf-intel-pt \- Support for Intel Processor Trace within perf tools
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIperf record\fR \-e intel_pt//
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Intel Processor Trace (Intel PT) is an extension of Intel Architecture that collects information about software execution such as control flow, execution modes and timings and formats it into highly compressed binary packets\&. Technical details are documented in the Intel 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals, Chapter 36 Intel Processor Trace\&.
.sp
Intel PT is first supported in Intel Core M and 5th generation Intel Core processors that are based on the Intel micro\-architecture code name Broadwell\&.
.sp
Trace data is collected by \fIperf record\fR and stored within the perf\&.data file\&. See below for options to \fIperf record\fR\&.
.sp
Trace data must be \fIdecoded\fR which involves walking the object code and matching the trace data packets\&. For example a TNT packet only tells whether a conditional branch was taken or not taken, so to make use of that packet the decoder must know precisely which instruction was being executed\&.
.sp
Decoding is done on\-the\-fly\&. The decoder outputs samples in the same format as samples output by perf hardware events, for example as though the "instructions" or "branches" events had been recorded\&. Presently 3 tools support this: \fIperf script\fR, \fIperf report\fR and \fIperf inject\fR\&. See below for more information on using those tools\&.
.sp
The main distinguishing feature of Intel PT is that the decoder can determine the exact flow of software execution\&. Intel PT can be used to understand why and how did software get to a certain point, or behave a certain way\&. The software does not have to be recompiled, so Intel PT works with debug or release builds, however the executed images are needed \- which makes use in JIT\-compiled environments, or with self\-modified code, a challenge\&. Also symbols need to be provided to make sense of addresses\&.
.sp
A limitation of Intel PT is that it produces huge amounts of trace data (hundreds of megabytes per second per core) which takes a long time to decode, for example two or three orders of magnitude longer than it took to collect\&. Another limitation is the performance impact of tracing, something that will vary depending on the use\-case and architecture\&.
.SH "QUICKSTART"
.sp
It is important to start small\&. That is because it is easy to capture vastly more data than can possibly be processed\&.
.sp
The simplest thing to do with Intel PT is userspace profiling of small programs\&. Data is captured with \fIperf record\fR e\&.g\&. to trace \fIls\fR userspace\-only:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf record \-e intel_pt//u ls
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
And profiled with \fIperf report\fR e\&.g\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf report
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To also trace kernel space presents a problem, namely kernel self\-modifying code\&. A fairly good kernel image is available in /proc/kcore but to get an accurate image a copy of /proc/kcore needs to be made under the same conditions as the data capture\&. \fIperf record\fR can make a copy of /proc/kcore if the option \-\-kcore is used, but access to /proc/kcore is restricted e\&.g\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sudo perf record \-o pt_ls \-\-kcore \-e intel_pt// \-\- ls
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which will create a directory named \fIpt_ls\fR and put the perf\&.data file (named simply \fIdata\fR) and copies of /proc/kcore, /proc/kallsyms and /proc/modules into it\&. The other tools understand the directory format, so to use \fIperf report\fR becomes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sudo perf report \-i pt_ls
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Because samples are synthesized after\-the\-fact, the sampling period can be selected for reporting\&. e\&.g\&. sample every microsecond
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sudo perf report pt_ls \-\-itrace=i1usge
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
See the sections below for more information about the \-\-itrace option\&.
.sp
Beware the smaller the period, the more samples that are produced, and the longer it takes to process them\&.
.sp
Also note that the coarseness of Intel PT timing information will start to distort the statistical value of the sampling as the sampling period becomes smaller\&.
.sp
To represent software control flow, "branches" samples are produced\&. By default a branch sample is synthesized for every single branch\&. To get an idea what data is available you can use the \fIperf script\fR tool with all itrace sampling options, which will list all the samples\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf record \-e intel_pt//u ls
perf script \-\-itrace=ibxwpe
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
An interesting field that is not printed by default is \fIflags\fR which can be displayed as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf script \-\-itrace=ibxwpe \-F+flags
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The flags are "bcrosyiABExgh" which stand for branch, call, return, conditional, system, asynchronous, interrupt, transaction abort, trace begin, trace end, in transaction, VM\-entry, and VM\-exit respectively\&.
.sp
perf script also supports higher level ways to dump instruction traces:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf script \-\-insn\-trace \-\-xed
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Dump all instructions\&. This requires installing the xed tool (see XED below) Dumping all instructions in a long trace can be fairly slow\&. It is usually better to start with higher level decoding, like
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf script \-\-call\-trace
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
or
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf script \-\-call\-ret\-trace
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
and then select a time range of interest\&. The time range can then be examined in detail with
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf script \-\-time starttime,stoptime \-\-insn\-trace \-\-xed
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
While examining the trace it\(cqs also useful to filter on specific CPUs using the \-C option
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf script \-\-time starttime,stoptime \-\-insn\-trace \-\-xed \-C 1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Dump all instructions in time range on CPU 1\&.
.sp
Another interesting field that is not printed by default is \fIipc\fR which can be displayed as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf script \-\-itrace=be \-F+ipc
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
There are two ways that instructions\-per\-cycle (IPC) can be calculated depending on the recording\&.
.sp
If the \fIcyc\fR config term (see config terms section below) was used, then IPC is calculated using the cycle count from CYC packets, otherwise MTC packets are used \- refer to the \fImtc\fR config term\&. When MTC is used, however, the values are less accurate because the timing is less accurate\&.
.sp
Because Intel PT does not update the cycle count on every branch or instruction, the values will often be zero\&. When there are values, they will be the number of instructions and number of cycles since the last update, and thus represent the average IPC since the last IPC for that event type\&. Note IPC for "branches" events is calculated separately from IPC for "instructions" events\&.
.sp
Even with the \fIcyc\fR config term, it is possible to produce IPC information for every change of timestamp, but at the expense of accuracy\&. That is selected by specifying the itrace \fIA\fR option\&. Due to the granularity of timestamps, the actual number of cycles increases even though the cycles reported does not\&. The number of instructions is known, but if IPC is reported, cycles can be too low and so IPC is too high\&. Note that inaccuracy decreases as the period of sampling increases i\&.e\&. if the number of cycles is too low by a small amount, that becomes less significant if the number of cycles is large\&. It may also be useful to use the \fIA\fR option in conjunction with dlfilter\-show\-cycles\&.so to provide higher granularity cycle information\&.
.sp
Also note that the IPC instruction count may or may not include the current instruction\&. If the cycle count is associated with an asynchronous branch (e\&.g\&. page fault or interrupt), then the instruction count does not include the current instruction, otherwise it does\&. That is consistent with whether or not that instruction has retired when the cycle count is updated\&.
.sp
Another note, in the case of "branches" events, non\-taken branches are not presently sampled, so IPC values for them do not appear e\&.g\&. a CYC packet with a TNT packet that starts with a non\-taken branch\&. To see every possible IPC value, "instructions" events can be used e\&.g\&. \-\-itrace=i0ns
.sp
While it is possible to create scripts to analyze the data, an alternative approach is available to export the data to a sqlite or postgresql database\&. Refer to script export\-to\-sqlite\&.py or export\-to\-postgresql\&.py for more details, and to script exported\-sql\-viewer\&.py for an example of using the database\&.
.sp
There is also script intel\-pt\-events\&.py which provides an example of how to unpack the raw data for power events and PTWRITE\&. The script also displays branches, and supports 2 additional modes selected by option:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-insn\-trace \- instruction trace
\-\-src\-trace \- source trace
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
As mentioned above, it is easy to capture too much data\&. One way to limit the data captured is to use \fIsnapshot\fR mode which is explained further below\&. Refer to \fInew snapshot option\fR and \fIIntel PT modes of operation\fR further below\&.
.sp
Another problem that will be experienced is decoder errors\&. They can be caused by inability to access the executed image, self\-modified or JIT\-ed code, or the inability to match side\-band information (such as context switches and mmaps) which results in the decoder not knowing what code was executed\&.
.sp
There is also the problem of perf not being able to copy the data fast enough, resulting in data lost because the buffer was full\&. See \fIBuffer handling\fR below for more details\&.
.SH "PERF RECORD"
.SS "new event"
.sp
The Intel PT kernel driver creates a new PMU for Intel PT\&. PMU events are selected by providing the PMU name followed by the "config" separated by slashes\&. An enhancement has been made to allow default "config" e\&.g\&. the option
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-e intel_pt//
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
will use a default config value\&. Currently that is the same as
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-e intel_pt/tsc,noretcomp=0/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which is the same as
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-e intel_pt/tsc=1,noretcomp=0/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note there are now new config terms \- see section \fIconfig terms\fR further below\&.
.sp
The config terms are listed in /sys/devices/intel_pt/format\&. They are bit fields within the config member of the struct perf_event_attr which is passed to the kernel by the perf_event_open system call\&. They correspond to bit fields in the IA32_RTIT_CTL MSR\&. Here is a list of them and their definitions:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ grep \-H \&. /sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/*
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/cyc:config:1
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/cyc_thresh:config:19\-22
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/mtc:config:9
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/mtc_period:config:14\-17
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/noretcomp:config:11
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/psb_period:config:24\-27
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/format/tsc:config:10
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that the default config must be overridden for each term i\&.e\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-e intel_pt/noretcomp=0/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
is the same as:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-e intel_pt/tsc=1,noretcomp=0/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
So, to disable TSC packets use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-e intel_pt/tsc=0/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
It is also possible to specify the config value explicitly:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-e intel_pt/config=0x400/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that, as with all events, the event is suffixed with event modifiers:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
u       userspace
k       kernel
h       hypervisor
G       guest
H       host
p       precise ip
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fIh\fR, \fIG\fR and \fIH\fR are for virtualization which is not supported by Intel PT\&. \fIp\fR is also not relevant to Intel PT\&. So only options \fIu\fR and \fIk\fR are meaningful for Intel PT\&.
.sp
perf_event_attr is displayed if the \-vv option is used e\&.g\&.

.SS "config terms"
.sp
The June 2015 version of Intel 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals, Chapter 36 Intel Processor Trace, defined new Intel PT features\&. Some of the features are reflect in new config terms\&. All the config terms are described below\&.
.sp
tsc Always supported\&. Produces TSC timestamp packets to provide timing information\&. In some cases it is possible to decode without timing information, for example a per\-thread context that does not overlap executable memory maps\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
The default config selects tsc (i\&.e\&. tsc=1)\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
noretcomp Always supported\&. Disables "return compression" so a TIP packet is produced when a function returns\&. Causes more packets to be produced but might make decoding more reliable\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
The default config does not select noretcomp (i\&.e\&. noretcomp=0)\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
psb_period Allows the frequency of PSB packets to be specified\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
The PSB packet is a synchronization packet that provides a
starting point for decoding or recovery from errors\&.

.fi
.if n \{\

supported (0 is always supported)\&.  Otherwise the default is 0\&.
.fi
.if n \{\

Intel PT sample size (%zu) may be too small for PSB period (%zu)

.sp
The default sample size is 4KiB\&.
.sp
The sample size is passed in aux_sample_size in struct perf_event_attr\&. The sample size is limited by the maximum event size which is 64KiB\&. It is difficult to know how big the event might be without the trace sample attached, but the tool validates that the sample size is not greater than 60KiB\&.
.SS "new snapshot option"
.sp
The difference between full trace and snapshot from the kernel\(cqs perspective is that in full trace we don\(cqt overwrite trace data that the user hasn\(cqt collected yet (and indicated that by advancing aux_tail), whereas in snapshot mode we let the trace run and overwrite older data in the buffer so that whenever something interesting happens, we can stop it and grab a snapshot of what was going on around that interesting moment\&.
.sp
To select snapshot mode a new option has been added:
.sp
.if n \{\

The default snapshot size is the auxtrace mmap size\&. If neither auxtrace mmap size nor snapshot size is specified, then the default is 4MiB for privileged users (or if /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid < 0), 128KiB for unprivileged users\&. If an unprivileged user does not specify mmap pages, the mmap pages will be reduced as described in the \fInew auxtrace mmap size option\fR section below\&.
.sp
The snapshot size is displayed if the option \-vv is used e\&.g\&.

.sp
Note that the existing functionality of \-m is unchanged\&. The auxtrace mmap size is specified by the optional addition of a comma and the value\&.
.sp
The default auxtrace mmap size for Intel PT is 4MiB/page_size for privileged users (or if /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid < 0), 128KiB for unprivileged users\&. If an unprivileged user does not specify mmap pages, the mmap pages will be reduced from the default 512KiB/page_size to 256KiB/page_size, otherwise the user is likely to get an error as they exceed their mlock limit (Max locked memory as shown in /proc/self/limits)\&. Note that perf does not count the first 512KiB (actually /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb minus 1 page) per cpu against the mlock limit so an unprivileged user is allowed 512KiB per cpu plus their mlock limit (which defaults to 64KiB but is not multiplied by the number of cpus)\&.
.sp
In full\-trace mode, powers of two are allowed for buffer size, with a minimum size of 2 pages\&. In snapshot mode or sampling mode, it is the same but the minimum size is 1 page\&.

.SS "Buffer handling"
.sp
There may be buffer limitations (i\&.e\&. single ToPa entry) which means that actual buffer sizes are limited to powers of 2 up to 4MiB (MAX_ORDER)\&. In order to provide other sizes, and in particular an arbitrarily large size, multiple buffers are logically concatenated\&. However an interrupt must be used to switch between buffers\&. That has two potential problems: a) the interrupt may not be handled in time so that the current buffer becomes full and some trace data is lost\&. b) the interrupts may slow the system and affect the performance results\&.
.sp
If trace data is lost, the driver sets \fItruncated\fR in the PERF_RECORD_AUX event which the tools report as an error\&.
.sp
In full\-trace mode, the driver waits for data to be copied out before allowing the (logical) buffer to wrap\-around\&. If data is not copied out quickly enough, again \fItruncated\fR is set in the PERF_RECORD_AUX event\&. If the driver has to wait, the intel_pt event gets disabled\&. Because it is difficult to know when that happens, perf tools always re\-enable the intel_pt event after copying out data\&.
.SS "Intel PT and build ids"
.sp
By default "perf record" post\-processes the event stream to find all build ids for executables for all addresses sampled\&. Deliberately, Intel PT is not decoded for that purpose (it would take too long)\&. Instead the build ids for all executables encountered (due to mmap, comm or task events) are included in the perf\&.data file\&.
.sp
To see buildids included in the perf\&.data file use the command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf buildid\-list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.fi
.if n \{\

.SS "Snapshot mode and event disabling"
.sp
In order to make a snapshot, the intel_pt event is disabled using an IOCTL, namely PERF_EVENT_IOC_DISABLE\&. However doing that can also disable the collection of side\-band information\&. In order to prevent that, a dummy software event has been introduced that permits tracking events (like mmaps) to continue to be recorded while intel_pt is disabled\&. That is important to ensure there is complete side\-band information to allow the decoding of subsequent snapshots\&.
.sp
A test has been created for that\&. To find the test:

.SS "perf record modes (nothing new here)"
.sp
perf record essentially operates in one of three modes: per thread per cpu workload only
.sp
"per thread" mode is selected by \-t or by \-\-per\-thread (with \-p or \-u or just a workload)\&. "per cpu" is selected by \-C or \-a\&. "workload only" mode is selected by not using the other options but providing a command to run (i\&.e\&. the workload)\&.
.sp
In per\-thread mode an exact list of threads is traced\&. There is no inheritance\&. Each thread has its own event buffer\&.
.sp
In per\-cpu mode all processes (or processes from the selected cgroup i\&.e\&. \-G option, or processes selected with \-p or \-u) are traced\&. Each cpu has its own buffer\&. Inheritance is allowed\&.
.sp
In workload\-only mode, the workload is traced but with per\-cpu buffers\&. Inheritance is allowed\&. Note that you can now trace a workload in per\-thread mode by using the \-\-per\-thread option\&.
.SS "Privileged vs non\-privileged users"
.sp
Unless /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid is set to \-1, unprivileged users have memory limits imposed upon them\&. That affects what buffer sizes they can have as outlined above\&.
.sp
The v4\&.2 kernel introduced support for a context switch metadata event, PERF_RECORD_SWITCH, which allows unprivileged users to see when their processes are scheduled out and in, just not by whom, which is left for the PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE, that is only accessible in system wide context, which in turn requires CAP_PERFMON or CAP_SYS_ADMIN\&.
.sp
Please see the 45ac1403f564 ("perf: Add PERF_RECORD_SWITCH to indicate context switches") commit, that introduces these metadata events for further info\&.
.sp
When working with kernels < v4\&.2, the following considerations must be taken, as the sched:sched_switch tracepoints will be used to receive such information:
.sp
Unless /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid is set to \-1, unprivileged users are not permitted to use tracepoints which means there is insufficient side\-band information to decode Intel PT in per\-cpu mode, and potentially workload\-only mode too if the workload creates new processes\&.
.sp
Note also, that to use tracepoints, read\-access to debugfs is required\&. So if debugfs is not mounted or the user does not have read\-access, it will again not be possible to decode Intel PT in per\-cpu mode\&.
.SS "sched_switch tracepoint"
.sp
The sched_switch tracepoint is used to provide side\-band data for Intel PT decoding in kernels where the PERF_RECORD_SWITCH metadata event isn\(cqt available\&.
.sp
The sched_switch events are automatically added\&. e\&.g\&. the second event shown below:

"Transactions" events correspond to the start or end of transactions\&. The \fIflags\fR field can be used in perf script to determine whether the event is a transaction start, commit or abort\&.
.sp
Note that "instructions", "branches" and "transactions" events depend on code flow packets which can be disabled by using the config term "branch=0"\&. Refer to the config terms section above\&.
.sp
"ptwrite" events record the payload of the ptwrite instruction and whether "fup_on_ptw" was used\&. "ptwrite" events depend on PTWRITE packets which are recorded only if the "ptw" config term was used\&. Refer to the config terms section above\&. perf script "synth" field displays "ptwrite" information like this: "ip: 0 payload: 0x123456789abcdef0" where "ip" is 1 if "fup_on_ptw" was used\&.
.sp
"Power" events correspond to power event packets and CBR (core\-to\-bus ratio) packets\&. While CBR packets are always recorded when tracing is enabled, power event packets are recorded only if the "pwr_evt" config term was used\&. Refer to the config terms section above\&. The power events record information about C\-state changes, whereas CBR is indicative of CPU frequency\&. perf script "event,synth" fields display information like this: cbr: cbr: 22 freq: 2189 MHz (200%) mwait: hints: 0x60 extensions: 0x1 pwre: hw: 0 cstate: 2 sub\-cstate: 0 exstop: ip: 1 pwrx: deepest cstate: 2 last cstate: 2 wake reason: 0x4 Where: "cbr" includes the frequency and the percentage of maximum non\-turbo "mwait" shows mwait hints and extensions "pwre" shows C\-state transitions (to a C\-state deeper than C0) and whether initiated by hardware "exstop" indicates execution stopped and whether the IP was recorded exactly, "pwrx" indicates return to C0 For more details refer to the Intel 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals\&.
.sp
PSB events show when a PSB+ occurred and also the byte\-offset in the trace\&. Emitting a PSB+ can cause a CPU a slight delay\&. When doing timing analysis of code with Intel PT, it is useful to know if a timing bubble was caused by Intel PT or not\&.
.sp
Error events show where the decoder lost the trace\&. Error events are quite important\&. Users must know if what they are seeing is a complete picture or not\&. The "e" option may be followed by flags which affect what errors will or will not be reported\&. Each flag must be preceded by either \fI+\fR or \fI\-\fR\&. The flags supported by Intel PT are: \-o Suppress overflow errors \-l Suppress trace data lost errors For example, for errors but not overflow or data lost errors:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-itrace=e\-o\-l
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The "d" option will cause the creation of a file "intel_pt\&.log" containing all decoded packets and instructions\&. Note that this option slows down the decoder and that the resulting file may be very large\&. The "d" option may be followed by flags which affect what debug messages will or will not be logged\&. Each flag must be preceded by either \fI+\fR or \fI\-\fR\&. The flags support by Intel PT are: \-a Suppress logging of perf events +a Log all perf events +o Output to stdout instead of "intel_pt\&.log" By default, logged perf events are filtered by any specified time ranges, but flag +a overrides that\&.
.sp
In addition, the period of the "instructions" event can be specified\&. e\&.g\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-itrace=i10us
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
sets the period to 10us i\&.e\&. one instruction sample is synthesized for each 10 microseconds of trace\&. Alternatives to "us" are "ms" (milliseconds), "ns" (nanoseconds), "t" (TSC ticks) or "i" (instructions)\&.
.sp
"ms", "us" and "ns" are converted to TSC ticks\&.
.sp
The timing information included with Intel PT does not give the time of every instruction\&. Consequently, for the purpose of sampling, the decoder estimates the time since the last timing packet based on 1 tick per instruction\&. The time on the sample is \fBnot\fR adjusted and reflects the last known value of TSC\&.
.sp
For Intel PT, the default period is 100us\&.
.sp
Setting it to a zero period means "as often as possible"\&.
.sp
In the case of Intel PT that is the same as a period of 1 and a unit of \fIinstructions\fR (i\&.e\&. \-\-itrace=i1i)\&.
.sp
Also the call chain size (default 16, max\&. 1024) for instructions or transactions events can be specified\&. e\&.g\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-itrace=ig32
\-\-itrace=xg32
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Also the number of last branch entries (default 64, max\&. 1024) for instructions or transactions events can be specified\&. e\&.g\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-itrace=il10
\-\-itrace=xl10
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that last branch entries are cleared for each sample, so there is no overlap from one sample to the next\&.
.sp
The G and L options are designed in particular for sample mode, and work much like g and l but add call chain and branch stack to the other selected events instead of synthesized events\&. For example, to record branch\-misses events for \fIls\fR and then add a call chain derived from the Intel PT trace:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf record \-\-aux\-sample \-e \*(Aq{intel_pt//u,branch\-misses:u}\*(Aq \-\- ls
perf report \-\-itrace=Ge
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Although in fact G is a default for perf report, so that is the same as just:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perf report
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
One caveat with the G and L options is that they work poorly with "Large PEBS"\&. Large PEBS means PEBS records will be accumulated by hardware and the written into the event buffer in one go\&. That reduces interrupts, but can give very late timestamps\&. Because the Intel PT trace is synchronized by timestamps, the PEBS events do not match the trace\&. Currently, Large PEBS is used only in certain circumstances: \- hardware supports it \- PEBS is used \- event period is specified, instead of frequency \- the sample type is limited to the following flags: PERF_SAMPLE_IP | PERF_SAMPLE_TID | PERF_SAMPLE_ADDR | PERF_SAMPLE_ID | PERF_SAMPLE_CPU | PERF_SAMPLE_STREAM_ID | PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC | PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER | PERF_SAMPLE_TRANSACTION | PERF_SAMPLE_PHYS_ADDR | PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR | PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER | PERF_SAMPLE_PERIOD (and sometimes) | PERF_SAMPLE_TIME Because Intel PT sample mode uses a different sample type to the list above, Large PEBS is not used with Intel PT sample mode\&. To avoid Large PEBS in other cases, avoid specifying the event period i\&.e\&. avoid the \fIperf record\fR \-c option, \-\-count option, or \fIperiod\fR config term\&.
.sp
To disable trace decoding entirely, use the option \-\-no\-itrace\&.
.sp
It is also possible to skip events generated (instructions, branches, transactions) at the beginning\&. This is useful to ignore initialization code\&.
.sp
.if n \{\

.sp
The q option changes the way the trace is decoded\&. The decoding is much faster but much less detailed\&. Specifically, with the q option, the decoder does not decode TNT packets, and does not walk object code, but gets the ip from FUP and TIP packets\&. The q option can be used with the b and i options but the period is not used\&. The q option decodes more quickly, but is useful only if the control flow of interest is represented or indicated by FUP, TIP, TIP\&.PGE, or TIP\&.PGD packets (refer below)\&. However the q option could be used to find time ranges that could then be decoded fully using the \-\-time option\&.

Note the q option does not specify what events will be synthesized e\&.g\&. the p option must be used also to show power events\&.
.sp
Repeating the q option (double\-q i\&.e\&. qq) results in even faster decoding and even less detail\&. The decoder decodes only extended PSB (PSB+) packets, getting the instruction pointer if there is a FUP packet within PSB+ (i\&.e\&. between PSB and PSBEND)\&. Note PSB packets occur regularly in the trace based on the psb_period config term (refer config terms section)\&. There will be a FUP packet if the PSB+ occurs while control flow is being traced\&.

.SS "dump option"
.sp
perf script has an option (\-D) to "dump" the events i\&.e\&. display the binary data\&.
.sp
When \-D is used, Intel PT packets are displayed\&. The packet decoder does not pay attention to PSB packets, but just decodes the bytes \- so the packets seen by the actual decoder may not be identical in places where the data is corrupt\&. One example of that would be when the buffer\-switching interrupt has been too slow, and the buffer has been filled completely\&. In that case, the last packet in the buffer might be truncated and immediately followed by a PSB as the trace continues in the next buffer\&.
.sp
To disable the display of Intel PT packets, combine the \-D option with \-\-no\-itrace\&.
.SH "PERF REPORT"

By default, perf report will decode trace data found in the perf\&.data file\&. This can be further controlled by new option \-\-itrace exactly the same as perf script, with the exception that the default is \-\-itrace=igxe\&.

Start an open\-ended perf record, tracing the VM process, do something on the VM, and then ctrl\-C to stop\&. IPC can be determined, hence cyc=1 can be added\&. Only kernel decoding is supported, so \fIk\fR must be specified\&. Intel PT traces both the host and the guest so \-\-guest and \-\-host need to be specified\&.

Now \fIperf inject\fR can be used to determine the VMX TCS Offset\&. Note, Intel PT TSC packets are only 7\-bytes, so the TSC Offset might differ from the actual value in the 8th byte\&. That will have no effect i\&.e\&. the resulting timestamps will be correct anyway\&.

Each virtual CPU has a different Virtual Machine Control Structure (VMCS) shown above with the calculated TSC Offset\&. For an unchanging TSC Offset they should all be the same for the same virtual machine\&.
.sp
Now that the TSC Offset is known, it can be provided to \fIperf inject\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ perf inject \-i perf\&.data\&.kvm \-\-vm\-time\-correlation="dry\-run 0xffffe42722c64c41"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note the options for \fIperf inject\fR \-\-vm\-time\-correlation are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[ dry\-run ] [ <TSC Offset> [ : <VMCS> [ , <VMCS> ]\&.\&.\&. ]  ]\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
So it is possible to specify different TSC Offsets for different VMCS\&. The option "dry\-run" will cause the file to be processed but without updating it\&. Note it is also possible to get a intel_pt\&.log file by adding option \-\-itrace=d
.sp
There were no errors so, do it for real
